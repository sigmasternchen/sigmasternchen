### Hi there :wave:

My name is Sigma and I am a software engineer from Germany.

When I'm not working on bigger (serious) projects I like doing stupid stuff in languages that are not meant to do any of that - it's a nice challenge. :yum:

Professionally, I mostly work with Java, Python, JavaScript, Go, ... that kind of stuff. In my free time, I also write a lot C and PHP (I have this really odd love-hate relationship with PHP - I even wrote a [blog post](https://blog.sigma-star.io/2022/11/php-sucks/) about it). Recently, I've been looking into Gleam - looks pretty interesting sofar.

Contributions to my projects are always welcome. :smile:
